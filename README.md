My Name is Devin, I'm a first year computer science student at Ryerson.

My project compiles the top 5 trending searches on google and displays them on the html webpage (not completed)

To set up and run this project. Both the html and css files must be saved to the same folder and can the html file can then be opened.

To set up the python file. One must first pip install pytrends into their terminal.
